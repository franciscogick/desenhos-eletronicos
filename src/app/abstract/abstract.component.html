        <p id="resumo">The present study takes place at the intersection of dramaturgy and technology, investigating new forms of dramaturgical writing that emerge with the appropriation of the contexts and possibilities of the digital medium. The research is developed from my perspective as a playwright, as a search for possibilities of displacement in my artistic path. I start from considering how reading and writing relations are transformed in our interactions with digital technologies, giving space to a diversity of creations of digital literature that distance themselves from the formats typical of traditional media such as the printed book, producing a wide spectrum of new textualities created on a computer to be read on a computer. In order to understand how this new digital context contributes to transformations in the theatrical text, I analyze 4 digital dramaturgical works, <span class="titulo-obra">Last song of Violeta Parra</span>, <span class="titulo-obra">TRANS.MISSION [A.DIALOGUE]</span>, <span class="titulo-obra">AI: when a robot writes a play </span>and <span class="titulo-obra">AI</span>, which use different technologies and explore different aesthetic strategies in dramaturgical composition. Finally, I draw a provisional map of characteristics found in the analyzed texts that can be productive for the research and creation of new digital dramaturgies — transformivity, modularity, multisequentiality, connectivity, interactivity, multimediality and de-dramatization —.</p>
